# Reachable

Reachable is a tool that uses Searchfox data (searchfox.org) to perform reachability
analysis on the mozilla-central code base. Examples for application include dead file
detection, finding OS-specific code in a certain area and determining how to reach
a certain file in general.


Note: This project is in a proof-of-concept stage and currently has limited capabilities.
